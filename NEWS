To support sparse bigwig data (created with -bg rather than -bga
option to coverageBed, resulting in no rows with 0 coverage), binSum
no longer returns an error code when chromEnd[i] !=
chromStart[i+1]. Instead, gaps in the coverage profile are properly
treated as bases with 0 coverage.

ConvertModelList returns modelSelection.

peak1.infeasible data set.

Step3 looks for a peak in the same place as previous model, but does
not enforce the seg1 < seg2 > seg3 constraint.

ConvertModelList returns segments for model with 0 peaks.

PeakSegJointSeveral function for running the C solver using several
suboptimality parameters, and taking the model with the min Poisson
loss for each model size.

rename seg_start_end to bin_start_end.

real data sets where buggy heuristic does not recover visually optimal
segmentations.

bugfix for heuristic optimization for cases where there is a solution
with non-zero index (writes new cumsum vec) before a better solution
with zero index (does not write a new cumsum vec, and was stuck with
the old cumsum vec).
